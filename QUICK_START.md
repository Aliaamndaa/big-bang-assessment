## What You Have

A complete, professional solution for your internship assessment with:

✅ **JavaScript solution** (`bigbang.js`) - Main working code
✅ **TypeScript version** (`bigbang.ts`) - Bonus to show versatility  
✅ **Test suite** (`test.js`) - Automated verification
✅ **Output file** (`output.json`) - Pre-generated correct output
✅ **Documentation** (`README.md`) - Professional step-by-step guide
✅ **GitHub guide** (`GITHUB_SETUP.md`) - How to push to GitHub
✅ **Project configuration** (`package.json`, `.gitignore`) - Professional setup

## ⚡ Fastest Way to Use This

### Option 1: Use the Pre-built Solution (Recommended)

1. **Download the folder** `big-bang-assessment`
2. **Navigate to it** in your terminal/command prompt
3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   node bigbang.js
   ```
4. **Verify it works**:
   ```bash
   node test.js
   ```
5. **Push to GitHub** - Follow `GITHUB_SETUP.md`

That's it! ✨

### Option 2: Understand and Customize

Read through the files in this order:
1. `README.md` - Understand the problem and solution
2. `bigbang.js` - See the implementation (well commented)
3. `test.js` - See how to verify correctness
4. `GITHUB_SETUP.md` - Learn how to push to GitHub

## 📝 What to Do for Your Assessment

1. ✅ **Test locally** - Make sure `node bigbang.js` works
2. ✅ **Create GitHub account** - If you don't have one
3. ✅ **Push to GitHub** - Follow the GITHUB_SETUP.md guide
4. ✅ **Share the repository** - Send the GitHub URL to the hiring team

## 🎯 Key Points for the Interview

If they ask about your solution, mention:

1. **Algorithm**: Used modulo operator to check divisibility
2. **Order matters**: Check combined condition (3 AND 5) first
3. **Clean code**: Well-commented, modular functions
4. **Testing**: Included verification tests
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with examples
6. **Bonus**: Provided TypeScript version as well

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Don't plagiarize** - Understand the code, be ready to explain it
- **Test it yourself** - Run it on your machine before submitting
- **Be honest** - If asked, you can say you got help, but make sure you understand every line
- **Ask questions** - During interview, showing curiosity is good
